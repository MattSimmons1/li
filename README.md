# li.js

li.js is a lightweight tool for creating formatted documents. It can be used to create reports, presentations, or just pretty notes with no installs and no time spent applying formatting.

### How to use

Take any text file and insert the following at the very top:

	<script src='https://rawgithub.com/MattSimmons1/li/master/li.js'></script>

Alternatively, download li.js, save it in the same folder as your document and import with:

	<script src="li.js"></script>

Then save the file as _.html_ and open in Google Chrome or Safari.

Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to add formatting to the text.
