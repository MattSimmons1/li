# li.js

li.js is a lightweight tool for creating formatted documents. It can be used to create reports, presentations, or just pretty notes with no installs and no time spent applying formatting.

### How to use

Take any text file and insert the following at the very top:

	<script src='https://li.js.org/li.js'></script>

Alternatively, download li.js, save it in the same folder as your document and import with:

	<script src="li.js"></script>

Then **save the file as .html** and open in any modern web browser.

Use [Markdown](https://li.js.org/Examples/cheat%20sheet.html#markdown) to add formatting to the text. Add interactive d3 charts with [li.d3 functions](https://li.js.org/Examples/cheat%20sheet.html#lijs--d3-functions)

See the official [website](https://li.js.org) for more.
