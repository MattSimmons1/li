# li.js

li.js is a lightweight tool for creating formatted documents. It can be used to create reports, presentations, or just pretty notes with no installs and no time spent applying formatting.

### How to use

Take any text file and insert the following at the very top:

	<script src='https://rawgithub.com/MattSimmons1/li/master/li.js'></script>

Alternatively, download li.js, save it in the same folder as your document and import with:

	<script src="li.js"></script>

Then **save the file as .html** and open in Google Chrome or Safari.

Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to add formatting to the text.

### More formatting options

On top of standard Markdown formatting, there are some extra li.js options:

Syntax | Result
--- | ---
**///** | creates a small gap equal to one tenth of the page height
**//////** | creates a large gap equal to half the page height (useful for creating gaps between slides in presentations)
